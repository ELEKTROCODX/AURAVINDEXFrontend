          <b>Important Notice:</b> <strong>AURA VINDEX</strong> is an academic
          project developed by <strong>ELEKTRO Team</strong>, represented by
          <strong>Alexander Morales</strong>, as part of a university simulation
          in El Salvador. This is not a registered company, and the application
          does not serve commercial purposes. All features, including
          subscriptions and book deliveries, are simulated. No real payments are

        <p>
          <strong>AURA VINDEX</strong> is a mobile application designed for a
          private library. It allows users to:

          <li>Search and browse books via a digital catalog.</li>
          <li>Request book loans to read within the library.</li>
          <li>Request home delivery of books (simulated).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The app is free to use and offers simulated subscription plans for
          additional features. These subscriptions do not involve any real
          payment or banking information.
