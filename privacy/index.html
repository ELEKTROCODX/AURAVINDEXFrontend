        <p>
          <b>Important Notice:</b> <strong>AURA VINDEX</strong> is an academic
          project developed by <strong>ELEKTRO Team</strong> as part of a
          university simulation in El Salvador. It is not a formal company and
          has no commercial purposes. All features, including subscriptions and
          delivery services, are simulated. No financial data is collected and
          no real transactions are performed.

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          We collect the following personal information when users create an
          account:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>First name and last name</li>
          <li>Email address</li>
          <li>Gender</li>
          <li>Date of birth</li>
          <li>User-uploaded photo/avatar</li>
          <li>Home address (only if requesting book delivery)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not collect phone numbers at the moment, but we may include this
          in the future for features such as 2FA via SMS. We do not collect IP
          addresses, device data, or sensitive personal data as defined by law.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also maintain internal audit records that log user actions within
          the app, linked to their database ID.
        </p>

        <h2>2. When Data is Collected</h2>
        <p>
          Data is collected only through the registration form when creating an
          account. No information is stored if the user does not register.

        <h2>3. How Data is Used</h2>
        <p>Your data is used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To create and manage your account</li>
          <li>To send account-related emails (e.g., password recovery)</li>
          <li>To verify age eligibility based on date of birth</li>

        <h2>4. Third Parties and Services</h2>
        <p>
          Currently, <strong>AURA VINDEX</strong> does not use third-party
          services to manage personal data. All data is stored securely on our
          own API server (<strong>AURAVINDEXAPI</strong>). We formerly used
          Nodemailer to send emails, and may update this in the future.
