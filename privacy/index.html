  <h1>Privacy Policy - AURA VINDEX</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 12, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Important Notice:</strong> <strong>AURA VINDEX</strong> is an academic project developed by <strong>ELEKTRO Team</strong> as part of a university simulation in El Salvador. It is not a formal company and has no commercial purposes. All features, including subscriptions and delivery services, are simulated. No financial data is collected and no real transactions are performed.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect the following personal information when users create an account:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First name and last name</li>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Gender</li>
    <li>Date of birth</li>
    <li>User-uploaded photo/avatar</li>
    <li>Home address (only if requesting book delivery)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not collect phone numbers at the moment, but we may include this in the future for features such as 2FA via SMS. We do not collect IP addresses, device data, or sensitive personal data as defined by law.</p>
  <p>We also maintain internal audit records that log user actions within the app, linked to their database ID.</p>

  <h2>2. How Data is Collected</h2>
  <p>Personal data is collected through the registration form when creating an account. If the user does not register, no personal data is stored.</p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>Your data is used for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To create and manage your account</li>
    <li>To send account-related emails (e.g., password recovery)</li>
    <li>To verify age eligibility based on date of birth</li>
    <li>To deliver books to your home address (if requested)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
  <p>We do not share your data with third parties. All information is stored securely on our own servers and accessed via our private API (<strong>AURAVINDEXAPI</strong>). Although we previously used Nodemailer for sending emails, we are currently considering alternative providers.</p>

  <h2>5. User Rights</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Request the deletion of their personal data (name, email, gender, date of birth, avatar, address)</li>
    <li>Modify or update their personal information via the profile editor</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Audit logs will be preserved for security and monitoring purposes, associated only with the user's database ID after deletion.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Our servers are hosted on Digital Ocean with secure access (SSH authentication). All passwords are encrypted. We currently do not perform regular data backups. (This may be reviewed in the future.)</p>
